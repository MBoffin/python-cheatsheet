# Python Beginner Cheat Sheet - Just the Basics
This is a cheat sheet I created for my students to use when learning Python. It is not comprehensive, as its intended to only cover the basics needed for simple programs. I've found it useful and I hope you do as well.

The descriptions are targeted at someone who knows _some_ basic terminology of programming, but not a lot. As a result, the language in the descriptions may be less technical or less precise than you would find in official documentation.

If you find typos, errors, inaccuracies, or have suggestions, please feel free to file an issue.

# Fonts
The font for the main text is [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald). I chose Oswald because of its legibility and slimness, allowing for more text per line.

The font for any code is [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono). I chose Fira Mono because of its distinction of `1liI` characters.
