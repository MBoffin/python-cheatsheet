# Python Beginner Cheat Sheet - Just the Basics
This is a simple Python cheat sheet I created for my students to use. Whether you are learning or teaching, I hope you find it useful.

The descriptions are targeted at someone who knows _some_ basic terminology of programming, but not a lot. As a result, the language may be less technical or less precise than you would find in official documentation.

If you find typos, errors, inaccuracies, or have suggestions, please feel free to file an issue.

â€”Dylan Bennett

# Fonts and Palette
The font for the main text is [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald). I chose Oswald because of its slimness, while still being legible. This allowed for more text per line.

The font for any code is [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono). I chose Fira Mono because of its slimness and distinction of `1liI` characters.

The color palette is the [Flat UI Palette v1](https://flatuicolors.com/palette/defo).
